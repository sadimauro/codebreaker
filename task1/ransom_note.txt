I have taken all of your files hostage using the best encryption technology.
You can get them back with a payment of 100 ETH.

So you may understand that payment is the wisest and only choice I will
explain.  The payment process uses smart contract technology and I have
provided you all of my source code which you can confirm on the blockchain to
be sure that you will receive the decryption key when you pay.  The only code I
have not given to you is the "oracle" that stores the keys.  It watches the
blockchain and will provide the key when it sees a payment with an accompanying
file that is correctly encrypted.  Any of your locked files will work.  If you
try to provide the wrong file or do not pay, you will not get the key.  But I also
will refund your money if the file does not decrypt.  So this is a fair exchange.

You can even see on the blockchain that others have paid and unlocked their
files.  You can trust this technology.

To receive the decryption key for your files:
1. make a transaction to the payRansom(...) function of the Escrow contract at address: 0x24486f98b8fB01a41C56366500751921eC0D923E
   - include value (payment) of 100 ETH
   - include your unique identification value: 0x516932143b57a201335f6bf20111716024a846e3e7af53baf3fc31a48d078566

Then, after the oracle confirms and deposits your decryption key, it may be
retrieved by reading the blockchain with:

2. "call" the getDecryptionKey() function of your unique Ransom contract at address: 0x7e0e2E49911A0c73632c1eA47Bbbb7B83ddD82bE
